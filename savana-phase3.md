## Critical Workflow Discoveries

### Phase 3 Data Advantage: Quality Information at Source

**Transformation Context**: Phase 3 now benefits from comprehensive, structured data flowing from previous phases, eliminating manual searching and guesswork:

**From Phase 1 (Enhanced ServiceM8 Quotes):**
- Property type and site access requirements already identified
- Safety hazards and SWMS requirements pre-captured at quote stage  
- PPE requirements documented based on job type and site conditions
- Equipment and asset requirements specified upfront
- Historical job patterns and similar project references
- Split entity classification (Savana vs Savana Environmental)

**From Phase 2 (Intelligent Scheduling):**
- Supervisor assignments determined through intelligent matching (not last-minute guessing)
- Technician qualifications verified against job requirements via ConnectTeam integration
- Worker availability and skills matched to specific job needs
- Similar job identification through historical pattern analysis
- Asset location and availability integrated with job requirements

### Enhanced Document Creation Process

**Critical Workflow Transformation**: Instead of manual searching and guesswork, Phase 3 safety documentation leverages pre-captured structured data:

1. **Automated Similar Job Identification**: Phase 1 historical references eliminate 30-60 minute manual searching
2. **Pre-Populated Job Details**: All addresses, dates, job numbers automatically available from enhanced ServiceM8
3. **Confirmed Supervisor Assignment**: Phase 2 intelligent scheduling provides verified supervisor allocation
4. **Qualified Worker Lists**: ConnectTeam integration confirms technician qualifications and site-specific inductions
5. **Pre-Identified Safety Requirements**: SWMS types and PPE needs determined at quote stage (Phase 1)
6. **Asset Integration**: Equipment requirements and locations from coordinated scheduling

### Document Review Process (Unchanged)

- **Hygienist Review**: All documents go to hygienist first for approval
- **Client Review**: Some clients review thoroughly, others just approve  
- **Revision Tracking**: Draft numbers increment with each revision
- **Copy Requirements**: Hygienists need copies before work starts (forms part of clearance)

### Site-Specific Requirements (Now Pre-Captured)

**Permit Variations (from Phase 1 quote data):**
- Hospital sites: Hot works permits for grinding
- UWA: Working at heights permits  
- Defence bases: Asbestos permits required
- Residential: Generally no special permits

**PPE Requirements (from Phase 1 hazard identification):**
- Site-specific requirements captured during quote process
- Technician-specific gear based on assigned worker qualifications

**Emergency Planning (Enhanced):**
- Site access and egress routes documented during quote stage
- Asset locations and emergency equipment pre-identified

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points Identified

| Area                 | Current Process                                                                           | Time Impact                           | Risk Level                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Template Discovery   | Manual searching through previous projects to find similar jobs                           | 30-60 minutes per search              | Medium - dependency on individual memory  |
| Document Creation    | Manual copy/paste and field-by-field updates across 15+ page documents                    | Hours per project                     | High - compliance risk                    |
| Document Timing      | Documents created reactively when jobs approach schedule (not at quote acceptance)        | Creates last-minute rush              | High - WorkSafe 5-day requirement at risk |
| Field Population     | Manual data entry from multiple disconnected systems (ServiceM8, ConnectTeam, scheduling) | Constant re-entry and verification    | High - transcription errors               |
| Emergency Planning   | Manual Google Maps screenshot and markup for every job site                               | 30-60 minutes per plan                | Medium - inconsistent quality             |
| Worker Documentation | Worker numbers change daily; documents show planned not actual                            | Documents don't reflect field reality | Medium - safety compliance                |

### Fragmented Data Sources

Current document creation pulls from multiple disconnected sources:
- **ServiceM8**: Basic job details, client info, quote scope (limited detail)
- **Scheduling System**: Job dates, worker numbers, priority queue
- **OneDrive**: SWMS template library, previous job folders for copying
- **Equipment Availability**: Manual estimates, no real-time inventory
- **Training Systems**: ConnectTeam + separate induction spreadsheets
- **Client Requirements**: Informal knowledge of review preferences
- **Staff Memory**: Jess's knowledge of "similar jobs done last week"
- **Verbal/Email**: Supervisor assignments, special requirements

**Impact**: No single source of truth; high dependency on individual knowledge

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Document Types Required

1. **ARCP (Asbestos Removal Control Plan)**
   - Required for every licensed removal job
   - Must differentiate between friable and bonded asbestos removal
   - Currently uses same templates despite different safety protocols required
   - Different SWMS selection needed based on material type
   - 15-20 pages typical
   - Must be submitted to WorkSafe 5 days before work 
   - Emergency jobs handled with temporary exemptions
   - Includes emergency evacuation plans (manually created from Google Maps)
   - **Hygienist Survey Integration**:
     - Not all jobs have pre-work surveys (especially private residential)
     - When present, attached to ServiceM8 but no systematic workflow
     - System must handle both surveyed and non-surveyed jobs

2. **SWMS (Safe Work Method Statement)**
   - Organised template library in OneDrive with job-type specific folders
   - Existing categorisation system (e.g., "Vinyl Tiles and Adhesive" folder)
   - Multi-factor template selection beyond simple job type matching
   - Daily risk assessments
   - Task-by-task hazard controls
   - Daily sign-on requirements
   - PPE assessments and equipment lists
   - Training requirements verification
   - Site-specific permit requirements

3. **Pre-starts**
   - Daily safety briefings
   - 20-30 minutes per supervisor to complete
   - Currently handwritten

4. **Additional Documents**
   - Emergency evacuation plans (manual Google Maps markup)
   - Supervisor checklists
   - Notification forms for WorkSafe
   - Hygienist review documentation

5. **Equipment Management Limitations**
   - No real-time inventory tracking of equipment check-in/check-out
   - Equipment list selection based on availability assumptions, not live data
   - Risk of equipment unavailability affecting job planning
   - **Note**: Equipment inventory system is separate future project
