# Synchronization Control Framework
## Digital Supply Chain Readiness Project - Document Management

**Created**: August 29, 2025  
**Purpose**: Maintain consistency between individual phase documents and project intelligence database  
**Critical**: Prevents project knowledge fragmentation across AI sessions

---

## The Problem We Solved

### Before Synchronization Control
- ❌ Individual phase documents could be updated independently
- ❌ Project intelligence became stale without warning
- ❌ Cross-phase analysis used outdated information  
- ❌ Budget calculations could drift out of sync
- ❌ New AI sessions lost context continuity

### After Synchronization Control
- ✅ Mandatory workflow prevents unsynchronized changes
- ✅ Real-time tracking of all document versions
- ✅ Automatic validation of key project metrics
- ✅ Change log preserves complete audit trail
- ✅ Session startup checks prevent stale data usage

## Control Architecture

### Document Hierarchy
```
project-intelligence.md (MASTER INTELLIGENCE)
├── savana-phase1.md
├── savana-phase2.md  
├── savana-phase3.md
├── savana-phase4.md
├── savana-master-project.md
└── CLAUDE.md (AI INSTRUCTIONS)
```

### Synchronization Flow
```
Phase Document Change → Intelligence Impact Assessment → Sync Update → Validation → Version Control
```

## Mandatory Workflow Protocol

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Pre-Change Assessment
Before making ANY changes to phase documents:
- [ ] **Read project-intelligence.md** for current context
- [ ] **Identify affected sections** in intelligence database
- [ ] **Note current timestamps** from sync control table
- [ ] **Estimate scope** of required intelligence updates

#### 2. Execute Document Changes
- [ ] **Make targeted changes** to specific phase document
- [ ] **Document exact changes** made (add/delete/modify)
- [ ] **Save file** and note new modification timestamp
- [ ] **Record change scope** for intelligence updates

#### 3. Synchronize Intelligence Database
- [ ] **Update affected sections** in project-intelligence.md
- [ ] **Revise cost calculations** if budget impacts
- [ ] **Update timeline** if schedule changes
- [ ] **Adjust dependencies** if integration changes
- [ ] **Revise risk assessments** if scope changes

#### 4. Validation & Control Updates
- [ ] **Verify budget totals** = $100,000 (ex GST)
- [ ] **Confirm timeline** fits Oct 1, 2025 - May 31, 2026
- [ ] **Validate dependencies** remain logically consistent
- [ ] **Check technology architecture** still feasible
- [ ] **Update sync control table** with new timestamps
- [ ] **Add change log entry** with details
- [ ] **Update intelligence timestamp** to current time

---

## Key Control Points

### Budget Validation
- Total must always equal **$100,000 (ex GST)**
- Phase distribution: **25%, 15%, 25%, 35%**
- Line items must sum correctly within each phase
- Cost per hour rates: **$125/hour development, $100/hour training/testing**

### Timeline Validation  
- **Start**: October 1, 2025 (fixed)
- **End**: May 31, 2026 (fixed)
- **Total Duration**: 35 weeks maximum
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1→2, Phases 1-2→3, Phases 1-3→4

### Technology Integration Validation
- **ServiceM8**: Limited API, quotes only
- **ConnectTeam**: Full integration, working well
- **MYOB**: Master data, two-way sync in Phase 4
- **OneDrive**: Document storage, no SharePoint

## Session Startup Protocol

### For Every AI Session
Before starting work on this project:

1. **Read Project Intelligence First**
   - `project-intelligence.md` contains complete project context
   - Check "Document Synchronization Control" section
   - Review change log for recent updates

2. **Timestamp Validation**
   - Compare recorded timestamps vs actual file dates
   - Flag any discrepancies as ⚠️ **SYNC WARNING**
   - Update intelligence before proceeding if stale

3. **Validation Checks**
   - Verify budget totals = $100,000
   - Confirm timeline = Oct 1, 2025 - May 31, 2026
   - Check phase dependencies are intact
   - Validate technology architecture consistency

4. **Read CLAUDE.md**
   - Contains current project instructions
   - Lists available session commands
   - Defines role and working approach

## Warning Signs & Recovery

### Stale Intelligence Indicators
- ❌ File timestamps don't match control table
- ❌ Budget calculations don't equal $100,000
- ❌ Timeline dates inconsistent across documents
- ❌ Phase dependencies contradict each other
- ❌ Technology architecture mismatches

### Emergency Recovery Process
If intelligence becomes severely out of sync:

1. **STOP ALL WORK** - Do not make further changes
2. **Document the Issue** - Note what's inconsistent
3. **Read All Source Files** - Gather current state
4. **Rebuild Intelligence** - Create synchronized version
5. **Validate Completeness** - Ensure no data lost
6. **Reset Control Headers** - Update all timestamps
7. **Test Validation** - Confirm budget/timeline/dependencies

## Advanced Session Commands

These commands are available through CLAUDE.md:

### Synchronization Commands
- `intelligence check` - Compare file timestamps and validate sync
- `synchronize intelligence` - Update intelligence after phase changes
- `dependency analysis [change]` - Assess cross-phase impacts

### Analysis Commands  
- `cost optimization` - Analyze budget allocation opportunities
- `integration review` - Validate technology architecture
- `timeline analysis` - Review critical path and dependencies
- `compliance audit` - Check Australian grant requirements

## Success Metrics

### Control Framework Success
- ✅ **Zero sync failures** across all sessions
- ✅ **100% budget accuracy** maintained
- ✅ **Timeline consistency** preserved
- ✅ **Dependency integrity** protected
- ✅ **Change history** completely documented

### Project Integration Success
- ✅ **Cross-phase analysis** possible without re-reading all files
- ✅ **Context continuity** maintained across session boundaries  
- ✅ **Token efficiency** through consolidated intelligence

- ✅ **Knowledge preservation** immune to conversation limits

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Maintenance
- **Weekly**: Verify all timestamps are current
- **Before Major Changes**: Full validation check
- **After Integration Work**: Complete dependency review
- **Session Boundaries**: Always check sync status

### Version Evolution

## Example: Successful Synchronization

**Scenario**: Adding 200 words about advanced scheduling to Phase 3

### Execution Trace
1. ✅ **Pre-Assessment**: Read intelligence, identified affected sections
2. ✅ **Change Made**: Added ML algorithms content to Phase 3
3. ✅ **Intelligence Sync**: Updated technical architecture section
4. ✅ **Validation**: Budget still $100k, timeline unchanged, dependencies intact
5. ✅ **Control Update**: Timestamps, change log, version headers updated

**Result**: Phase 3 enhanced while maintaining complete project consistency
