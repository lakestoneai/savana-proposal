### Current System Limitations

| Area | Current Process | Time Impact | Risk Level |
|------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| ServiceM8 Limitations | No Android app, limited API, no completion trigger | Variable delays | High - incomplete automation |
| Job Completion | Still paper-based despite digital systems | 2-3 hours/day | Critical - compliance gap |
| Quote to Invoice | Manual data transfer between systems | 1-2 hours/day | Medium - billing delays |
| Field Data Capture | Limited to photos, no structured forms | Lost opportunities | Medium - quality issues |
| Split Entity Management | Manual tracking Savana/Savana Environmental | 30 mins/day | High - compliance risk |

### Current Workflow Gaps

- **Field Worker Systems**: Field workers use ConnectTeam for time but ServiceM8 for jobs (disconnected)
- **Job Completion Trigger**: No digital job completion trigger for invoicing
- **Safety Documentation**: Safety documents exist digitally but aren't linked to job completion
- **MYOB Integration**: MYOB integration is one-way only (can't update or delete)
- **Job Profitability**: No real-time visibility of job profitability

## Proposed Solution: Custom Field Management Platform
