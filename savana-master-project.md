# Digital Transformation Project Proposal

**Client:** Savana Environmental  
**Location:** Perth, Western Australia  
**Proposed by:** Lakestone AI  
**Project Duration:** 37 Weeks (October 1, 2025 - June 17, 2026)  
**Total Investment:** $96,000 (ex GST)  
**Proposal Type:** Business Process Automation & Systems Integration

## Executive Summary

Savana Environmental is seeking to eliminate inefficiency, duplication, and compliance risk caused by manual, disjointed systems. At present, quoting, safety documentation, scheduling, and field operations operate in silos, relying heavily on paper-based processes and individual knowledge. This limits scalability, increases compliance risk, and creates unnecessary administrative overhead that constrains business growth.

Lakestone AI proposes a comprehensive digital transformation project that establishes a single, integrated digital workflow beginning with structured data capture at the quotation stage. Every job will start with a complete, consistent dataset — including address, hazards, permits, resources, and client details — ensuring downstream processes are accurate and reliable.

**The Investment:** $96,000 over 35 weeks delivers 383% ROI with 7.4-month payback period and $154,640 annual operational savings.

**Key Benefits:**
- Safety documentation: 2-3 hours → 30 minutes per job
- Scheduling efficiency: 4-6 hours daily → <1 hour daily  
- Field operations: 100% elimination of paper processes
- Business continuity: Systematic knowledge capture reducing single-person dependencies
- Compliance assurance: Automated WorkSafe and ISO standards adherence

**Four-Phase Integrated Approach:**

**Phase 1 - ServiceM8 Enhancement & Data Quality:** Upgrade existing ServiceM8 system to capture comprehensive job intelligence at source, establishing the quality data foundation that enables all subsequent automation.

**Phase 2 - Intelligent Scheduling System:** Replace dual Excel spreadsheet chaos with automated resource allocation system that uses Phase 1 data to optimise worker deployment, verify qualifications, and eliminate manual scheduling overhead.

**Phase 3 - Safety Documentation Automation:** Implement API-connected document templates that leverage integrated data from Phases 1-2 to automatically generate ARCP and SWMS documents, reducing creation time from hours to minutes whilst ensuring WorkSafe compliance.

**Phase 4 - Mobile Field Enablement:** Provide mobile access to the integrated digital ecosystem, enabling field teams to operate entirely digitally with real-time compliance visibility and seamless office synchronisation.

By sequencing the transformation in this logical progression, Savana Environmental will move from fragmented, paper-heavy processes to an end-to-end digital platform that links quotation → scheduling → safety documentation → field execution in a unified workflow. This systematic approach ensures each phase builds upon quality data established in previous phases, maximising automation effectiveness whilst minimising implementation risk.

## Project Overview

### Strategic Objective

Transform Savana Environmental from fragmented, manually-intensive operations into a digitally-integrated enterprise through systematic quality data capture at source, intelligent resource allocation, automated safety compliance, and mobile field operations.

### Current State Analysis

**Root Cause: Fragmented Data Systems**
- Disconnected systems (ServiceM8, ConnectTeam, MYOB, Excel) create data silos
- Manual transcription between systems introduces errors and delays
- Single-person knowledge dependencies create business continuity risks

**Operational Impact:**
- **Scheduling Crisis**: 4-6 hours daily maintaining dual Excel spreadsheets
- **Documentation Burden**: 2-3 hours per safety document with manual template searching
- **Field Inefficiency**: Paper-based processes with 2-3 hours daily processing
- **Cash Flow Constraints**: 5-7 day quote-to-invoice cycle limiting growth capability

### Future State Vision

**Integrated Digital Workflow:**
- ServiceM8 capturing comprehensive job intelligence at source
- Automated resource scheduling with qualification verification
- API-connected safety documentation with pre-population
- Mobile field operations with real-time synchronisation
- Unified reporting across all business functions

## Solution Architecture Summary

**Core Principle:** Quality data captured once at source enables intelligent automation across all downstream processes, eliminating duplicate entry, reducing errors, and maximising operational efficiency.

### Integration Flow
```
Phase 1: Data Quality → Phase 2: Intelligent Scheduling → 
Phase 3: Automated Documentation → Phase 4: Mobile Operations
```
