# Digital Supply Chain Readiness for Major Infrastructure Projects

**Company:** Savana Environmental  
**Location:** Perth, Western Australia  
**Project Duration:** 35 Weeks (October 1, 2025 - May 31, 2026)  
**Total Investment:** $100,000 (ex GST)  
**Grant Application:** Australian Government Supply Chain Resilience Initiative

---

## Executive Summary

Savana Environmental seeks $100,000 in grant funding to implement a comprehensive digital transformation project that will position our business to compete effectively in major infrastructure project supply chains. As a specialised asbestos removal contractor serving property managers, insurance companies, principal builders, councils, and federal facilities across Perth, we currently face significant operational constraints that limit our capacity to tender for and deliver large-scale projects.

This 35-week digital transformation initiative comprises four integrated phases that systematically build our capability from foundational safety compliance automation through to a complete project delivery platform. Beginning with digitising our proven safety documentation processes, progressing through mobile field operations and intelligent resource management, and culminating in a unified project management platform, this project directly addresses the Australian Government's priority of strengthening domestic supply chain capabilities for major infrastructure delivery.

Our current manual processes consume over 50% of administrative time on safety documentation, scheduling, and project management - directly impacting our ability to scale for larger contracts. This digital transformation will reduce documentation time by 90%, eliminate paper-based field processes entirely, and create real-time visibility across all operations. The integrated platform will enable us to manage multiple concurrent major projects whilst maintaining the stringent safety and compliance standards required for infrastructure work.

The project aligns with national infrastructure priorities by enhancing a critical specialist contractor's capacity to support major demolition and construction projects. With asbestos present in 1 in 3 Australian buildings constructed before 1990, professional asbestos removal services are essential for infrastructure renewal. This investment will enable Savana Environmental to scale from current project values of $50,000-$200,000 to compete for major infrastructure contracts exceeding $1 million, directly supporting Australia's infrastructure pipeline.

## Project Overview

### Strategic Objective

Transform Savana Environmental from a paper-based, manually-intensive operation into a digitally-enabled enterprise capable of competing for and delivering major infrastructure projects through systematic automation of safety compliance, field operations, resource management, and project delivery systems.

### Current State Challenges

| Challenge Area | Current Impact | Major Project Limitation |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Safety Documentation | 4+ hours per project creating ARCP/SWMS documents | Cannot scale documentation for multiple concurrent projects |
| Field Operations | Paper-based processes with 2-3 hours daily processing | No real-time visibility for project managers on large sites |
| Resource Scheduling | Manual Excel "by the minute" updates | Unable to optimise resources across multiple project sites |
| Project Management | Disconnected systems (ServiceM8, ConnectTeam, MYOB) | No integrated view for major project reporting |
| Compliance Tracking | Manual verification across multiple systems | Risk of non-compliance on complex projects |
| Invoice Processing | 5-7 day quote-to-invoice cycle | Cash flow constraints for large project mobilisation |

### Future State Capability

Upon completion of this digital transformation, Savana Environmental will operate with:

- **Automated Safety Compliance**: AI-powered documentation reducing creation time to under 30 minutes
- **Mobile Field Operations**: 100% digital field processes with real-time compliance visibility
- **Intelligent Resource Management**: Automated scheduling optimising 30+ workers across multiple sites
- **Integrated Project Platform**: Unified system from quote to completion with real-time cost tracking
- **Major Project Readiness**: Capability to manage 5+ concurrent major projects with full compliance
