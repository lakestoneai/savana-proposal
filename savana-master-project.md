# Digital Transformation Project Proposal

**Client:** Savana Environmental  
**Location:** Perth, Western Australia  
**Proposed by:** Lakestone AI  
**Project Duration:** 35 Weeks (October 1, 2025 - May 31, 2026)  
**Total Investment:** $100,000 (ex GST)  
**Proposal Type:** Business Process Automation & Systems Integration

---

## Executive Summary

Savana Environmental is seeking to eliminate inefficiency, duplication, and compliance risk caused by manual, disjointed systems. At present, quoting, safety documentation, scheduling, and field operations operate in silos, relying heavily on paper-based processes and individual knowledge. This limits scalability, increases compliance risk, and creates unnecessary administrative overhead that constrains business growth.

Lakestone AI proposes a comprehensive digital transformation project that establishes a single, integrated digital workflow beginning with structured data capture at the quotation stage. Every job will start with a complete, consistent dataset — including address, hazards, permits, resources, and client details — ensuring downstream processes are accurate and reliable.

This 35-week transformation initiative comprises four sequential phases that systematically build capability from enhanced data capture through to complete mobile field operations:

**Phase 1 - ServiceM8 Enhancement & Data Quality:** Upgrade existing ServiceM8 system to capture comprehensive job intelligence at source, establishing the quality data foundation that enables all subsequent automation.

**Phase 2 - Intelligent Scheduling System:** Replace dual Excel spreadsheet chaos with automated resource allocation system that uses Phase 1 data to optimise worker deployment, verify qualifications, and eliminate manual scheduling overhead.

**Phase 3 - Safety Documentation Automation:** Implement API-connected document templates that leverage integrated data from Phases 1-2 to automatically generate ARCP and SWMS documents, reducing creation time from hours to minutes whilst ensuring WorkSafe compliance.

**Phase 4 - Mobile Field Enablement:** Provide mobile access to the integrated digital ecosystem, enabling field teams to operate entirely digitally with real-time compliance visibility and seamless office synchronisation.

By sequencing the transformation in this logical progression, Savana Environmental will move from fragmented, paper-heavy processes to an end-to-end digital platform that links quotation → scheduling → safety documentation → field execution → invoicing in a unified workflow. This systematic approach ensures each phase builds upon quality data established in previous phases, maximising automation effectiveness whilst minimising implementation risk.

## Project Overview

### Strategic Objective

Transform Savana Environmental from a fragmented, manually-intensive operation into a digitally-integrated enterprise capable of competing for and delivering major infrastructure projects through systematic quality data capture at source, intelligent resource allocation, automated safety compliance, and mobile field operations enabling seamless project delivery at scale.

### Current State Challenges

| Challenge Area | Current Impact | Major Project Limitation |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Fragmented Data Systems | Disconnected systems (ServiceM8, ConnectTeam, MYOB, Excel) | No integrated view for major project reporting |
| Manual Scheduling Chaos | Dual Excel spreadsheet "by the minute" updates (4-6 hours daily) | Cannot optimise resources across multiple project sites |
| Safety Documentation | Manual template searching and 2-3 hours per document creation | Cannot scale documentation for multiple concurrent projects |
| Paper Field Operations | Physical processes with 2-3 hours daily processing | No real-time visibility for project managers on large sites |
| Single-Person Dependencies | Critical knowledge residing with individual staff members | Business continuity risk for major project delivery |
| Invoice Processing | 5-7 day quote-to-invoice cycle | Cash flow constraints for large project mobilisation |

### Future State Capability

Upon completion of this digital transformation, Savana Environmental will operate with:

- **Enhanced Data Capture**: ServiceM8 system capturing comprehensive job intelligence at source with quality data feeding all downstream processes
- **Intelligent Resource Management**: Automated scheduling system replacing dual Excel spreadsheets, optimising 30+ workers across multiple sites
- **Automated Safety Compliance**: API-connected documentation templates reducing creation time to under 30 minutes using integrated data
- **Mobile Field Operations**: 100% digital field processes with real-time compliance visibility and seamless office synchronisation
- **Major Project Readiness**: Capability to manage 5+ concurrent major projects with full compliance and integrated reporting

## Conclusion

This digital transformation project will deliver immediate and measurable benefits to Savana Environmental's operational efficiency whilst establishing a scalable foundation for business growth. By systematically addressing the root causes of current inefficiencies — fragmented data systems, manual scheduling chaos, time-intensive safety documentation, and paper-based field operations — Lakestone AI's proposed solution creates an integrated digital workflow that eliminates duplication and reduces compliance risk.

The benefits are immediate and quantifiable: 50%+ reduction in administrative effort, safety documentation reduced from 4+ hours per job to under 30 minutes, full elimination of paper-based field processes, and real-time scheduling visibility that reduces conflicts and last-minute adjustments. Just as importantly, the platform ensures full alignment with ISO 45001 (safety) and ISO 27001 (information security) standards, giving Savana Environmental the compliance maturity required to scale confidently.

With demonstrated ROI within 8 months and sustainable competitive advantages, this $100,000 investment transforms Savana Environmental from a manually-intensive operation into a technology-enabled enterprise capable of handling increased project volume whilst maintaining exceptional safety and compliance standards. The phased implementation approach minimises risk whilst ensuring each capability builds logically upon the previous phase's data quality improvements.

Lakestone AI is committed to delivering this transformation within the 35-week timeframe and providing ongoing support to ensure Savana Environmental realises the full benefits of their digital transformation investment.
