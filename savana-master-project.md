# Digital Supply Chain Readiness for Major Infrastructure Projects

**Company:** Savana Environmental  
**Location:** Perth, Western Australia  
**Project Duration:** 35 Weeks (October 1, 2025 - May 31, 2026)  
**Total Investment:** $100,000 (ex GST)  
**Grant Application:** Australian Government Supply Chain Resilience Initiative

---

## Executive Summary

Savana Environmental seeks $100,000 in grant funding to implement a comprehensive digital transformation project that will position our business to compete effectively in major infrastructure project supply chains. As a specialised asbestos removal contractor serving property managers, insurance companies, principal builders, councils, and federal facilities across Perth, we currently face significant operational constraints that limit our capacity to tender for and deliver large-scale projects.

This 35-week digital transformation initiative comprises four integrated phases that systematically build our capability from quality data capture at source through to complete mobile field operations. Beginning with enhancing our existing ServiceM8 system to capture comprehensive job intelligence, progressing through intelligent scheduling system replacement, automated safety documentation, and culminating in mobile field access, this project directly addresses the Australian Government's priority of strengthening domestic supply chain capabilities for major infrastructure delivery.

Our current manual processes consume over 50% of administrative time on safety documentation, scheduling, and project management - directly impacting our ability to scale for larger contracts. This digital transformation will reduce documentation time by 90%, eliminate paper-based field processes entirely, and create real-time visibility across all operations. The integrated platform will enable us to manage multiple concurrent major projects whilst maintaining the stringent safety and compliance standards required for infrastructure work.

The project aligns with national infrastructure priorities by enhancing a critical specialist contractor's capacity to support major demolition and construction projects. With asbestos present in 1 in 3 Australian buildings constructed before 1990, professional asbestos removal services are essential for infrastructure renewal. This investment will enable Savana Environmental to scale from current project values of $50,000-$200,000 to compete for major infrastructure contracts exceeding $1 million, directly supporting Australia's infrastructure pipeline.

## Project Overview

### Strategic Objective

Transform Savana Environmental from a fragmented, manually-intensive operation into a digitally-integrated enterprise capable of competing for and delivering major infrastructure projects through systematic quality data capture at source, intelligent resource allocation, automated safety compliance, and mobile field operations enabling seamless project delivery at scale.

### Current State Challenges

| Challenge Area | Current Impact | Major Project Limitation |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Fragmented Data Systems | Disconnected systems (ServiceM8, ConnectTeam, MYOB, Excel) | No integrated view for major project reporting |
| Manual Scheduling Chaos | Dual Excel spreadsheet "by the minute" updates (4-6 hours daily) | Cannot optimise resources across multiple project sites |
| Safety Documentation | Manual template searching and 2-3 hours per document creation | Cannot scale documentation for multiple concurrent projects |
| Paper Field Operations | Physical processes with 2-3 hours daily processing | No real-time visibility for project managers on large sites |
| Single-Person Dependencies | Critical knowledge residing with individual staff members | Business continuity risk for major project delivery |
| Invoice Processing | 5-7 day quote-to-invoice cycle | Cash flow constraints for large project mobilisation |

### Future State Capability

Upon completion of this digital transformation, Savana Environmental will operate with:

- **Enhanced Data Capture**: ServiceM8 system capturing comprehensive job intelligence at source with quality data feeding all downstream processes
- **Intelligent Resource Management**: Automated scheduling system replacing dual Excel spreadsheets, optimising 30+ workers across multiple sites
- **Automated Safety Compliance**: API-connected documentation templates reducing creation time to under 30 minutes using integrated data
- **Mobile Field Operations**: 100% digital field processes with real-time compliance visibility and seamless office synchronisation
- **Major Project Readiness**: Capability to manage 5+ concurrent major projects with full compliance and integrated reporting

## Implementation Approach

The project follows a progressive capability-building approach across four sequential phases:
