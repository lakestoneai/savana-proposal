## Document Ecosystem Structure

### **Core Documents Hierarchy**
```
üìÅ grant-application/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìã CLAUDE.md (THIS FILE) - Structural instructions and workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üß† project-intelligence.md - ALL PROJECT KNOWLEDGE (READ FIRST)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ savana-master-project.md - Master proposal framework  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ savana-phase1.md - Individual phase documents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ savana-phase2.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ savana-phase3.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ savana-phase4.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìã SYNC-CONTROL-GUIDE.md - Synchronization procedures
```

### **Document Relationships**
- **project-intelligence.md** = Master knowledge database (complete project context)
- **Individual phase docs** = Detailed implementation specifications  
- **savana-master-project.md** = Overall proposal framework
- **SYNC-CONTROL-GUIDE.md** = Version control and change management procedures

---

## MANDATORY Session Startup Protocol

### **Step 1: Read Project Intelligence FIRST**
```
ALWAYS start by reading: project-intelligence.md
```
**Contains**: Complete client context, technical architecture, costs, timelines, dependencies, stakeholder information

### **Step 2: Check Synchronization Status**  
- Review "Document Synchronization Control" section in project intelligence
- Validate file timestamps match recorded versions
- Flag any ‚ö†Ô∏è sync warnings before proceeding

### **Step 3: Identify Work Scope**
- Determine which documents need updates
- Assess cross-phase impacts using dependency matrix
- Plan synchronization requirements

---

## Core Workflow Protocols

### **When Reading Files**
1. **project-intelligence.md** = Complete project understanding (ALWAYS read first)
2. **Individual phase docs** = Specific technical details as needed
3. **Master project** = Overall proposal structure and executive content

### **When Making Changes** 
**MANDATORY 5-Step Process:**
1. **Pre-Change Assessment**: Read current intelligence, identify affected sections
2. **Make Document Changes**: Update target documents with specific changes
3. **Intelligence Synchronization**: Update project intelligence database accordingly  
4. **Validation**: Ensure budget=$96K, timeline fits Oct 1, 2025 - June 17, 2026
5. **Version Control**: Update sync headers, change log, timestamps

### **Quality Assurance Checkpoints**
- **Budget Validation**: Total always equals $96,000 (ex GST)
- **Timeline Validation**: All work completes by June 17, 2026 (with 4-week integration period)
- **Australian Standards**: Language, currency (AUD), business culture compliance
- **Technical Feasibility**: Integration approach realistic with known system limitations

## Available Session Commands

### **Synchronization Management**
- `intelligence check` - Compare file timestamps and validate sync status
- `synchronize intelligence` - Update project intelligence after phase changes  
- `dependency analysis [change]` - Assess cross-phase impacts of proposed changes

### **Proposal Development**  
- `cost optimization` - Analyze budget allocation across phases
- `integration review` - Validate technology architecture feasibility
- `timeline analysis` - Review critical path and delivery schedule
- `proposal review` - Evaluate overall proposal strength and credibility
- `client perspective` - Assess from client viewpoint for gaps/improvements

---

## Working Standards

### **Language Requirements**
- **Australian English**: organisation, optimisation, recognised, colour, behaviour
- **Currency**: AUD ex GST throughout all financial references
- **Business Tone**: Professional but not overly formal (Australian business culture)
- **Technical Accuracy**: Precise terminology for systems integration and compliance

### **Documentation Standards**
- **No Coding**: Focus on business process transformation and system integration
- **Local Environment**: All work performed on local file system  
- **Version Control**: Maintain synchronization between all documents using established protocols
- **Change Management**: Complete audit trail of all modifications with timestamps

### **Quality Control**
- **Consistency**: All documents must align on budget, timeline, and technical approach
- **Feasibility**: Technical solutions must be realistic given known system limitations
- **Completeness**: Address all client requirements within deadline constraints
- **Professional Standards**: Maintain consultant-level quality and credibility

---

## Critical Success Factors

### **For Every Work Session**
‚úÖ **Read project intelligence first** - Never start without complete context  
‚úÖ **Validate synchronization** - Ensure all documents are current  
‚úÖ **Follow change protocols** - Maintain version control discipline  
‚úÖ **Check quality gates** - Budget, timeline, technical feasibility  
‚úÖ **Document changes** - Complete audit trail in change log

### **For Proposal Quality**
‚úÖ **Client Focus**: Address specific business challenges and requirements  
‚úÖ **Technical Credibility**: Realistic approach with proven integration patterns  
‚úÖ **Financial Justification**: Clear ROI with defensible cost breakdowns  
‚úÖ **Risk Management**: Honest acknowledgment of limitations with mitigation strategies  
‚úÖ **Implementation Confidence**: Achievable timeline within client constraints

## Emergency Procedures

### **If Synchronization Fails**
1. **Stop all work** - Do not make further changes
2. **Read SYNC-CONTROL-GUIDE.md** - Follow emergency recovery procedures  
3. **Rebuild intelligence** - Create synchronized version from source documents
4. **Validate completeness** - Ensure no project knowledge lost
5. **Reset control framework** - Update all timestamps and version headers

### **If Documents Become Inconsistent**
1. **Use project intelligence as master** - Authoritative source for all project details
2. **Compare individual phase docs** - Identify discrepancies  
3. **Apply synchronization protocol** - Update affected documents systematically
4. **Validate budget and timeline** - Ensure $96K total and June 17, 2026 deadline maintained

**Remember**: You are a digital transformation consultant developing proposals for clients. This document ecosystem supports sophisticated cross-phase analysis while maintaining perfect synchronization. Always read project-intelligence.md first for complete context, then follow established protocols for any document changes.

**Critical**: Focus on proposal development excellence, not technical implementation. Your expertise is in business transformation, system integration planning, and compelling proposal creation.
