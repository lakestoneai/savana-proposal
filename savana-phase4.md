## Field Documentation Challenges

### Current Paper-Based Limitations

- **Physical Document Risk**: Hard copies vulnerable to loss, damage, and weather exposure
- **Version Control Issues**: Field teams often work with outdated document versions
- **Manual Process Delays**: 20-30 minute handwritten pre-starts, 2-3 hours daily processing
- **Compliance Visibility**: Office has no real-time view of field safety documentation completion
- **Connectivity Dependency**: Field teams must call office for updates or amendments

### Digital Field Requirements

- **Offline Capability**: Perth job sites often have poor connectivity
- **Legal Compliance**: Digital signatures must meet WorkSafe audit standards
- **Mobile Optimisation**: Interface suitable for field conditions and work environments
- **Real-time Sync**: Immediate updates across office and field systems when connected 

## Proposed Solution: Digital Field Documentation System
